GENSHIN.DEV
A fan-made Genshin Impact API for easy access to game data.

This API is weird and inconsistent.
However, I decided to use it and make changes to the front-end if needed.

Problems with this API:
    - Missing identifiers (Accessing characters based on names causes many errors)
    - Missing resources, such as icons
    - Ambiguous error handling
